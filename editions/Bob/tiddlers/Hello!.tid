title: Hello!

!Welcome to the Bob ~TiddlyWiki.

!! Connecting other computers to the wiki

''BIG NOTE OF DOOM or what is the local network?:'' The local network is anyone
using the same router as you. This means anyone on the same wifi network or
using a wired connection on the same router. So when you are at starbucks or a
library on the wifi anyone else who is on that wifi is on the local network.

By default the wiki is only available on `localhost` on the computer you are
running the node process on.

If you want to make it available to other computers on the local network you
have to change the settings in the $:/ControlPanel under the `Bob Settings`
tab.

There are a few tabs available in the `Bob Settings`:

* The `Manage Wikis` tab lets you create new wikis and manage existing wikis.
* The `This Wiki` tab lets you change the plugins and themes that are available and active in the current wiki.
* The `Server` tab lets you do things that affect the wiki server, like making the wikis available on the local network and setting up a static file server to access local media files.
* The `Federation` tab has some very experimental things, they probably won't work well.
* The `Bob Documentation` tab has further documentation about Bob.
* The `About OokTech/Support Documentation` tab has information about OokTech and how to to support the further development of Bob and the related plugins.

Things you may want to do:

* Enable the [[media file server|$:/plugins/OokTech/Bob/FileServerSetup]]
* Enable the [[ServerImages plugin|$:/plugins/OokTech/Bob/SelectPlugins]] (requires the media server to be enabled)
* Make the served wikis [[available on the local network|$:/plugins/OokTech/Bob/ServerTab]]
