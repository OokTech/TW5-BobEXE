title: Hello!

!Welcome to the Bob ~TiddlyWiki.

!! Connecting other computers to the wiki

''BIG NOTE OF DOOM or what is the local network?:'' The local network is anyone
using the same router as you. This means anyone on the same wifi network or
using a wired connection on the same router. So when you are at starbucks or a
library on the wifi anyone else who is on that wifi is on the local network.

By default the wiki is only availble on `localhost` on the computer you are
running the node process on. If you want to make it availble to other computers
than you need to set the host to `0.0.0.0`. But this means that anyone on the
local network will be able to access the wiki. To do this go to the
`Node Settings` tab on the $:/ControlPanel and click on the value listed for
`host` under `ws-server`, it is `127.0.0.1` by default. If you set it to
`0.0.0.0` then click `Done` and then click on `Update Settings`. Then you need
to restart the wiki server.

  Host has to be set to `0.0.0.0` in order to connect from other computers.

    />
    <$action-websocketmessage
      $type=saveSettings
    />
  </$button>
  to set the host to `0.0.0.0`

  Then wait a moment for the settings files to be updated on the server (the
  save icon shold turn back to grey) and stop then restart the server to make
  this wiki accessible to other computers on the network.

  After setting the host and restarting you can connect to this wiki from another
  computer on the same network by entering the above into the address bar of a
  browser.

  You can then create and edit tiddlers in any connected wiki.

  The wiki server ip address and port is:

  <pre>{{$:/ServerIP}}:{{$:/ServerIP!!port}}</pre>

  The host is set to `0.0.0.0`, this means that this wiki is available to
  anyone on the local network. See the big note of doom above.

    <$action-websocketmessage

  </$button>
  to set the host to `127.0.0.1`.

  Then wait a moment for the settings files to be updated on the server (the
  save icon shold turn back to grey) and stop then restart the server to make
  this wiki only accessible on the computer running it.
